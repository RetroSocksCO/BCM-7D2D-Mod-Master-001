Getting wet in this area will increase radiation absorption.\nIncreased radiation will make you weaker and more susceptible to injuries. 100% radiation will give you mortal injuries.\nEquip the Nomad armor to reduce exposure.\nExiting the Wasteland slowly decreases radiation poisoning, while clean rain or immersion in uncontaminated water will more effectively remove radioactive contaminants.",,
